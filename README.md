# üéôÔ∏è Voice Typing with Whisper AI  

Effortlessly convert your speech into text using OpenAI's **Whisper** speech-to-text model! This project demonstrates two innovative approaches to voice typing:  

1. **Keypress-Based Voice Typing**: Press and hold a key to record your voice, release it to process, and the text appears wherever your cursor is placed.  
2. **Automatic Voice Detection**: Using Silero VAD (Voice Activity Detection), the system detects when you‚Äôre speaking and transcribes it automatically.
